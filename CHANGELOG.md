## DSkipList 1.0.0 (Feb 26, 2014) ##

* Changed all range operations so that they do not include the first element specified (from)

* Ranges now accept nonexistent start and endpoints and the list will still behave, which is more useful for
* real world situations in which you dont know exactly what values are in your list
